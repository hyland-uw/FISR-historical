# Testing and instrumenting versions of the fast inverse square root

The code and data here are components of a larger investigation into the history and re-use of the Fast Inverse Square Root, including [the most famous implementation found in Quake III Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root). The larger project website is here, at [0x5f37642f.com](https://0x5f37642f.com/).

This project is a work in progress.

## Mode of operation

Run `make` in the base directory to generate csvs in the data directory. Sampling parameters are set in the sampling-harness.h file.

The project works only on single precision `float` variables, not doubles (As the integer representation is different)

### Compilation note

This project is on an M1 mac, so the makefile has specific settings to use OpenMP. Adjust those for your system.

## Organization

The project is organized by file name. Data is generated by c files, stored as csvs, and operated on by R files. An example is approximated.c -> approximated.csv -> approximated.R. The graphing library ggplot2 is used for most plots, with a legacy file (FISR-plotting.R) that contains base R plots.

All c files use `sampling-harness.h` which contains parameters for generation and common functions.

#### Approximated

Computes errors of historical FRSR style approximations over a range of floats, including Quake III's FISR. Data appears broken down by specific approximation:

| ISR_function | input | reference | initial | final |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BlinnISR | 0.3209153 | 1.765244 | 1.858170 | 1.763802 |
| QuakeISR | 0.3209153 | 1.765244 | 1.790600 | 1.764695 |
| withoutDivISR | 0.3209153 | 1.765244 | 1.809832 | 1.763541 |
| optimalFISR | 0.3209153 | 1.765244 | 1.608169 | 1.765233 |

With this data, we can cleanly plot different approximations and see their error over an input range.

#### Deconstructed

Replaces the usual iteration limit of 1-2 Newton-Raphson iterations with iteration to a tolerance, which supports plotting the space for random inputs and magic constants.

| input | reference | initial | final | iters | magic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.574197 | 1.319683 | 0.341227 | 1.319682 | 7 | 1580741785 |
| 0.186377 | 2.316348 | 1.789107 | 2.316348 | 4 | 1594125894 |
| 0.181007 | 2.350457 | 0.591144 | 2.350457 | 7 | 1580466735 |
| 0.629445 | 1.260437 | 0.655565 | 1.260436 | 5 | 1589142732 |

This format allows us to explore "bad" magic constants which produce poor approximations. The number of iterations to reach the right answer is a gross measure of the poor fit of the approximation. Visually this can produce some striking representations of the NR space.

#### Enumerated
Does the unusual job of enumerating a "best" magic constant for a given float. Imagine the world's least efficient lookup table.

| input | reference | initial | final | magic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.5134103 | 1.3956220 | 1.3957580 | 1.3956220 | 1597267869 |
| 0.7665635 | 1.1421570 | 1.1421160 | 1.1421570 | 1597263768 |
| 0.5133603 | 1.3956900 | 1.3957830 | 1.3956900 | 1597267666 |
| 1.2038200 | 0.9114215 | 0.9114995 | 0.9114215 | 1597399913 |

![Distribution of errors by magic constant](/plots/enumerated_error.png)

For a given float (the dataset is not ordered by input) we compute the result of many different magic constants. For an input float there is a "best" magic constant which we determine. This also allows us to look at constants across a large range of floats.

#### Optimized
Performs a grid search of the Newton Raphson constants (~1.5 and ~0.5) over a range of floats and a specific magic constant. Used to show the role of the NR approximation step.

| input | initial | halfthree | halfone | error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1954819 | 2.301005 | 1.495 | 0.495 | 0.0002761815 |
| 0.1954819 | 2.301005 | 1.495 | 0.496 | 0.0013290450 |
| 0.1954819 | 2.301005 | 1.495 | 0.497 | 0.0023820130 |
| 0.1954819 | 2.301005 | 1.495 | 0.498 | 0.0034350870 |

A basic grid search is used, but the code can be modified for a more sophisticated search. 1.5 and 0.5 are optimal over most of the range, which makes older deviations from that interesting. Slicing the data like this allows us to clearly see the optimality of 0.5 and 1.5.

#### Sliced
Maps the performance of a range of magic constants across sets of floats to visualize slices of the output.

| input | error | magic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.712697 | 1.515474e-03 | 1597466973 |
| 1.712697 | 5.446439e-03 | 1597826541 |
| 1.712697 | 9.883186e-05 | 1597165521 |
| 1.712697 | 3.928469e-03 | 1597712212 |

![Deciles of error across possible inputs](/plots/decile.png)

In contrast to the above, these slices compute a range of outputs for a given float. So for an input `1.712697` many thousands of magic constants are used and the approximation generated. This can be used for plotting curves across floats, which is difficult to do with the other data slices.

## Future directions

Ideally the end point for this is an R package containing data as well as functions to call the underlying C code at will. What needs to happen for that is:

1. [Convert the existing C code to C++](https://legalizeadulthood.wordpress.com/2007/05/18/refactoring-convert-c-to-c/) to allow the use of [Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html) which has a much better interface than between  R and C.
2. Refactor the existing R and C code from the current mode of batch process to CSV to to an R function like generate_timelines() which would call the underlying C++ code with passed parameters.
3. Generate exemplary datasets and store them in .Rdata format.
4. Convert the whole project into a package with named exported functions and data.

Future needs for the project apart from that:
* Actual documentation
* Once packaging is finished, potentialy moving the project to CRAN
