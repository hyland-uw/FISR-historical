This is work in progress.

Code for testing and instrumenting version of the fast inverse square root.

Compile FISR-instrumentation with -O0 to disable optimization (otherwise some elements are optimized out and the output is wrong). The executable will produce a csv and plots I have so far are in FISR-plotting.R
